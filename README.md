# C++ Experiment 3: Exploring Decision-Making Statements

---

## Aim

- Understand how decision-making statements work in C++.
- Use relational and logical operators to guide program decisions based on user input.

---

## Tool Used

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

---

## Objectives

- Implement conditional branching using if, if-else, and nested if-else constructs.
- Apply relational operators to compare values and define decision criteria.
- Combine conditions with logical operators for complex decision-making.
- Develop programs that:
  - Identify whether a number is positive or negative.
  - Assign student grades according to percentage marks.
  - Determine the quadrant of a point in 2D coordinate geometry.

## Theory

### Why Decision-Making Statements?

Programs often need to execute different instructions based on conditions. Decision-making allows selective execution, making software interactive and adaptable. It is foundational to building intelligent and responsive applications.

---

### Types of Decision Statements

- **If Statement:** Executes code only when a specific condition holds true.
- **If-Else Statement:** Offers an alternative path when the condition is false.
- **Nested If-Else:** Allows multiple conditions to be evaluated in a structured way.

---

### Relational Operators

Used to compare values and produce Boolean outcomes, including equality, inequality, and greater or lesser comparisons.

---

### Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple relational expressions, allowing complex conditions through AND, OR, and NOT operations.

---

## Program Overview

- Accepts user inputs such as numbers, marks, or coordinates.
- Uses conditional checks to evaluate the inputs.
- Outputs results based on the evaluation, such as the sign of a number, a grade category, or a quadrant location.

---

## Applications

1. **Sign Identification:** Determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
2. **Grading System:** Calculate percentage marks from subject scores and classify into grade categories.
3. **Quadrant Detection:** Identify which quadrant a point lies in on the Cartesian plane, or if it lies on the origin or an axis.

---

## Sample Outputs

- Indicating the positivity or negativity of variables.
- Showing a studentâ€™s grade based on percentage marks.
- Displaying the quadrant or origin position of coordinates.
